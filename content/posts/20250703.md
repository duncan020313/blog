Before vibe coding, there was a no-code solution that ultimately failed.
The fundamental reason was the limits of complexity and the difficulties
of maintenance. While it was possible to build simple prototypes,
creating complex services, ensuring security, and maintaining systems
were impossible without understanding the code. Vibe coding, so far, is
following a similar path.

This phenomenon stems from the inherent ambiguity of natural language. A
sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways, and the interpretation
itself is natural language, so it is ambiguous too. If we recursively
remove ambiguity until a sentence can be interpreted in only one way,
then it is no longer natural language but a formal
language.

The essence of programming is the process of translating natural
language descriptions into formal language. In this process, the
ambiguity is naturally removed because of the strict definition of the
formal language. Forcing a requirement to be interpreted as one meaning
only, in a single way, is the main role of a formal language.

Since each has a different role, natural language cannot replace
programming languages. If we explain the intention in natural language,
ambiguity will occur, and there is always a possibility that the
intention will be differently interpreted during the process of
translation. Therefore, natural languages cannot replace programming
languages and that is why vibe coding cannot completely replace coding.
