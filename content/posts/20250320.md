The evolution of technology follows a pattern of high expectations,
setbacks, and improvements. The development of compilers and high-level
languages exemplifies this pattern. When high-level languages emerged,
many believed they would simplify programming and reduce the need for
technical expertise. However, these technologies have created new
opportunities for programming language researchers.

The era of natural language programming has arrived, blurring the
boundaries between programming languages and human communication. Does
this transformation render programming language research obsolete?

Not at all. New technologies introduce new challenges, particularly the
gap between natural language specifications and code implementations. In
conventional compilers, translation validation ensures the compiled
program matches the source code. We need similar tools to bridge the gap
between natural language and code.

Another challenge lies in high-level language optimization. Unlike
conventional optimization in compilers using rule-based optimization,
high-level optimization often requires algorithmic changes that are
difficult to represent in formal rules. Language models could help by
generating optimization guidelines beyond strict rules. These models
could then identify and apply optimizations to existing programs, with
verification mechanisms to ensure success.
