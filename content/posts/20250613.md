title: "Why don't we keep our prompts?"

Vibe coding is a new way of coding that supervises coding agents using
natural language. However, the way of interacting with agents is still
chat-style. Chat is not a suitable method of interaction for vibe
coding.

In chat, what is said is lost. Once it is lost, it is practically
impossible to retrieve. But in vibe coding, what is said to the language
model is a kind of code specification, which is very important.
Therefore, we should preserve prompts while being able to track which
parts were generated by each prompt.

Chat-style interaction makes users write prompts carelessly. Even if the
first instruction is vague, it can be corrected in the next instruction.
However, this repetitive correction work confuses the language model and
makes the code bloated. Refactoring and optimizing such spaghetti code
is not easy even for developers.

Instead, vibe coding should be changed to a method of writing permanent
documents, and the language model should asynchronously rewrite the code
based on the documents and modification requests. This approach removes
the temporal dimension, preventing the language model from storing
unnecessary change timelines in the context. Furthermore, it allows
developers and agents to continuously focus on the core goal while
writing code.
