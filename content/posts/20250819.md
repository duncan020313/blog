title: "Specifications Are Coming"

Specifications are documents that describe how software should behave
and what functions it must perform. In other words, they are a separate form of implementation that exists independently of the actual program. By leveraging
specifications, we can verify that our software is constructed correctly, which
improves its safety and reliability.

Yet maintaining specifications is hard and boring. Because specifications
do not directly improve performance or features, most companies neglect
them. Once a specification falls behind, it quickly degrades into legacy that
nobody reads or maintains.

But with the advent of AI developers, the situation has completely
changed. The most important thing when working with AI developers is
to provide detailed, concrete objectives. In short, writing good specifications becomes the most important element.

Now we must consider how to write specifications well. Methods and
tools for writing specifications are still less mature than programming itself. I predict that future programming systems research will focus on specification
writing and related areas.

Let’s imagine an ideal programming system: Human programmers write
a specification, and AI developers implement the program according to the
specification. If a human changes the specification, AI developers update the
program. Equivalence between the specification and the implementation is
automatically proven by an AI-based verification engine.
