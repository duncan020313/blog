title: "A Language for Writing Prompts"

It is arduous to read and remember a whole prompt written in natural
language. For example, Claude's system prompt is 16,000 words long. If
the subject described in the prompt is constantly changing (e.g., API
specification), the prompt must be continuously updated, which is a
demanding task.

This problem is very similar to the issue of inconsistency between
traditional software specifications and their implementation. Because
specifications are written in natural language, if the person in charge
forgets, changes in the implementation may not be reflected in the
specification, and discovering such inconsistencies also presents a
challenge.

Developing a programming language for writing prompts could be one
solution. This is because if prompts are written in a formal language,
it is possible to develop tools to analyze and verify their correctness.
However, writing everything in a formal language, while powerful, is
often too complex and inefficient for the general public.

Another approach is to find an intermediate form between natural
language and formal language, and use language models to verify the
correctness of the prompt. One example is to wrap the changing parts
with a `<Mutable>` tag, and have the language model repeatedly check the
content of this section in a CI process. A kind of markup language for
writing prompts could be created by introducing various tags.
